## FAQ

#### What is the purpose of this project?

For us(the creators), this project is a means to sharpen our knowledge and abilities, especially in programming & academics. Also this project helps Benedict land a job(hopefully) as a programmer by building his github portfolio.

For users, this project is used to compound notes, summaries and practice questions from the internet and/or school for your convenience in obtaining magna cumlaude or above(depends on your dedication and hard work).

We wish to integrate this project with canitutor in the future. Providing study materials that can be easily distributed and accessed (at least compared to whatsapp).

#### How do I collaborate?

- Webdev: Make sure that you are capable of `filling in one or more role` in the tech stack(look below).
- Materials: Just `get good grades, take notes, and make videos that breaks down past tests/assignments`, submit it to Gabrio or Benedict. We'll include your name on the **"special thanks"** page. **NOTE: Tutors from the Canitutor community are eligable to collaborate. Just send the notes to us**

## Features

- Main page
- Login(WIP, The schedule in CC is hectic)
- Admin panel: Authorize and check the quality of the notes(WIP)
- Page for students to upload their own notes (WIP)
- UPDATE: I maybe should change to `Django` and use `webpack` instead of `vite`. If I use vite I need to go do some `CORS` wizardry, which I dislike.
